# ML Study Quest (Hands-On Machine Learning companion)

This repository now includes **ML Study Quest**, a SwiftUI starter app that turns *Hands-On Machine Learning* into a gamified learning experience inspired by Duolingo and Brilliant. The app consumes lessons and quizzes from a JSON file, tracks XP and streaks, and supports multiple question types.

## Features

- ðŸ“š **Structured lessons** â€” Each chapter can be broken into multiple lessons with text, bullet lists, code blocks, and callouts.
- ðŸ§  **Interactive quizzes** â€” Multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, and ordering questions with instant feedback.
- ðŸŽ® **Gamification** â€” XP rewards, daily streak tracking, and unlockable badges via `GamificationService`.
- ðŸ§± **Modular architecture** â€” MVVM layering with dedicated models, view models, services, and SwiftUI views for maintainability.

## Project structure

```
MLStudyApp/
â”œâ”€â”€ MLStudyAppApp.swift           # Entry point that injects gamification as an environment object
â”œâ”€â”€ Models/                       # Codable domain models (Lesson, QuizQuestion)
â”œâ”€â”€ ViewModels/                   # ObservableObject view models for lessons/quizzes
â”œâ”€â”€ Services/                     # Content loading + gamification persistence
â”œâ”€â”€ Views/                        # SwiftUI screens and reusable components
â””â”€â”€ Resources/content.json        # Sample lesson + quiz based on Chapter 1
```

> **Tip:** Create an assets catalog in Xcode if you plan to use images referenced in lesson content.

## Getting started

1. Open Xcode (v14 or later) and create a new **App** project called `MLStudyApp` with the SwiftUI interface and Swift language.
2. Replace the autogenerated files with the counterparts from the `MLStudyApp/` folder in this repository. Drag the entire folder into the Xcode project navigator and ensure **Copy items if needed** is checked so the JSON file is bundled.
3. Add `content.json` to the **Copy Bundle Resources** build phase. Run the project in the iOS simulator.

## Extending the content

Add additional lessons by appending new entries to `Resources/content.json`. Each lesson entry follows this schema:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "UUID",
  "title": "Lesson title",
  "subtitle": "Lesson subtitle",
  "content": [
    {
      "id": "UUID",
      "type": "text | bulletList | callout | code | image",
      "text": "Optional text",
      "code": "Optional code snippet",
      "imageName": "Optional asset catalog name"
    }
  ],
  "quiz": [
    {
      "id": "UUID",
      "type": "multipleChoice | fillInTheBlank | ordering",
      "prompt": "Question prompt",
      "options": [
        {
          "id": "UUID",
          "text": "Answer choice text",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "feedback": "Optional feedback"
        }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Only for fill in the blank",
      "correctOrder": ["UUID", "UUID"]
    }
  ]
}
```

You can generate draft questions with AI tooling, then review them before adding them to the JSON file. Store long-form lesson text in Markdown if you need richer formatting.

## Suggested production roadmap

1. **Content ingestion pipeline** â€“ Convert each book chapter to the JSON schema, optionally using scripting + LLMs for question generation.
2. **Gamification polish** â€“ Hook streaks into local notifications, add leaderboards via GameKit, and introduce more badge types.
3. **Spaced repetition** â€“ Schedule daily review sessions based on quiz performance.
4. **Analytics & A/B testing** â€“ Use Firebase Analytics or AppCenter to learn which lessons cause drop-off and iterate.

The existing HTML/CSS/JS files are kept for reference but are no longer used by the SwiftUI app.
